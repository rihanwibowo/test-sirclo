Sirclo technical test for UI/UX Engineer

<h2> Answer </h2>

<h3> Question 1: </h3>

To create a user-centric product, I used Design Thinking as my method to design a digital product. I believe that by understanding the human needs we can find user problems and pain points so we can find a solution to solve the problems. This method consists of five stages which sometimes not always sequential and can be repeated as an iteration for a better product.

The first step is <b> Empathise. </b> As can be seen on Financian project, I conduct research to understand what people think about managing their finances. This step is crucial to gain insight and aside down my assumptions about people’s awareness of financial planning.

After that comes the second step which is <b> Define.</b> After a bunch of data collected, usually, I analyzed and try to define what the core problem from my thesis. Again, as can be seen from Financian project, after conduct research I find that a large number of respondents (61.5 %) from a total of 26 people totally agree that managing income and expenses is important for them while only 3.8 % who disagree. That confirms managing cashflow must be an important thing in one person's finance.

On the other hand, only 7.7 % of the respondent totally agree that they track their income and expenses well, while 9.2 % of respondent who disagree and 11.5 % who totally disagree reflect that most of the respondents find it hard to track their income and expenses. No respondent disagrees that it is important to have a technology that can help one's financial planning. It confirms that there must be a technology to help people track and record their cash flow and help them reach their financial dream in the future.

I also create a user persona to help me define what type of user that going to be a fictional representation of the ideal customer. A persona can be helpful because it contains the needs, goals, pain points, and behavior patterns of the target audience.

The next step is <b> Ideate. </b> I try to brainstorm what possible solutions for my problems. At this step usually, I used Crazy Eights to push beyond my ideas. After several sketches, the best solution can be chosen as the solution sketch that useful to create a wireframe and prototype.

After that comes <b> Prototype. </b> This is one of the most exciting times in the whole process. Usually, I used Figma or Adobe XD to either create a either Low-Fidelity Prototype or High-Fidelity Prototype. I believe that is stage is experimental and the reiteration process can be repeated over and over again.

The last step is <b> Test. </b> One of the most important parts of the process is testing the product. I try to get as much as possible feedbacks to gain a better understanding of better design in the future. As can be seen from Parkin project, after Usability Testing I got some insights that useful for my next design iteration.

<h3> Question 2: </h3>

I think Financian brings me the most pride. Because it is my first time designing a comprehensive digital product. Before that, I only learn to craft a beautiful design without understanding the reason behind it. This product comes from my concern that my generation find it had to manage their finance.  After conduct research I’m glad that my thesis was right and I’m confident with my design.

I hope that with this design my generation can have the ability to track and record their finances, to invest wisely, and also to achieve their financial dream.

<h3> Question 3: </h3>

That was a time when I become a part of Parkin project team. In the beginning, we approved that we will create a wireframe and prototype on Adobe XD. But as time goes on, collaboration features on Adobe XD have a frequent error. Because the design system was already finished and some screens have already under development, in the middle of the project we agreed that we must migrate to Figma. After migrated to Figma, almost all of the designs become disorganized. And since the deadline for the usability test is tight, we focus on fix the design first for the Usability Testing and put the design system later. We believe this because a better collaboration feature on Figma will help our team to work more efficiently in the future.
